Creating a test AIO
===================

Leapfrog AIO test Process
-------------------------

Build virtual instance with at least 6vcpu, 15GB RAM, 160gb SDD
The flavor ID: 7 (15GB Standard Instance) works well using the
`Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr) (PVHVM)` image.

Once the test VM is online, simply clone this repo, checkout your
desired branch, set the RE_JOB_ACTION and run the script
`run-tests.sh`. This will perform the upgrade exactly as gating
job hooks will.

It should follow this format:

.. code-block:: shell

    RE_JOB_ACTION=<from_version>_to_<to_version>_<upgrade_action>

An example would be:

.. code-block:: shell

    export RE_JOB_ACTION=kilo_to_newton_leap ./run-tests.sh


If you wish to run the tests against a specific version, set the
from and to versions in `RE_JOB_ACTION` to the versions or branches
you wish to test with.

.. code-block:: shell

    export RE_JOB_ACTION=r12.2.8_to_r14.6.0_leap
    ./run-tests.sh


When you executing the `run-tests.sh` script a full AIO will be
built and then the upgrade tools executed against it. This will
allow for the rapid testing and proto-typing within a localized
environment.

If you wish to turn the upgrade off for testing prior to upgrade
you can set `RUN_UPGRADE` to false and then manually upgrade.

======================================
Creating a test MNAIO (Multi Node AIO)
======================================

Leapfrog MNAIO Test Process
---------------------------

Build an OnMetal server using the flavor onmetal-io1 and running
Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

You'll need to set the RE_JOB_IMAGE to xenial_mnaio in order to
trigger the mnaio code path.  Then set the action to set the
leap you want to test.

.. code-block:: shell

    export RE_JOB_IMAGE=xenial_mnaio
    export RE_JOB_ACTION=kilo_to_newton_leap
    ./run-tests.sh


This should kick off the Multi Node AIO build, then prep the
rpc-openstack, push the configs to infra1 and boot start the
RPC-O deploy from there.  By default an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
(trusty) image is used for the VMs for all leapfrog jobs.

If you wish to turn the upgrade off for testing prior to upgrade
you can set `RUN_UPGRADE` to false and then manually upgrade.
