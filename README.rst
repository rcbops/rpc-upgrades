Leapfrog Documentation
======================


Overview
--------

A Leapfrog upgrade is a major upgrade that skips at least one release. Currently
RPCO supports leapfrog upgrades from kilo to r14.2.0 (newton).


Terms
-----

* `RPCO <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack>`_: Rackspace Private Cloud powered by OpenStack
* `OSA <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible>`_:  OpenStack Ansible
* `OSA-OPS <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-ansible-ops>`_:  OpenStack Operations
* `Kilo <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/tree/kilo>`_: The RPCO release of OpenStack Kilo
* `r14.2.0 <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/tree/r14.2.0>`_: The second RPCO release of OpenStack Newton. This version includes Leapfrog upgrade tools.


Pre Leapfrog Tasks
------------------

* Verify that the kilo deployment is healthy and at the latest version.
* Perform Database housekeeping to prevent unnecessary migrations.


F5 Modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In cases where an F5 is used to facilitate load balancing several monitors,
virtual-servers and pools will need to be added or modified. While our F5
processing script will provide an actual diff on a per-environment basis, here
are the high-level changes that will need to be made.

ADD monitors:
  - Add the git repo pointed at the repo server on port 9418
  - Add the repo cache pointed at the repo server on port 3142
  - Add the novnc console pointed at the console containers on port 6080
  - Add an http monitor for the horizon containers on port 80

ADD pools:
  - Add a new pool for galera on port 3306
  - Add a new pool for the git repo on port 9418
  - Add a new pool for the repo cache on port 3142
  - Add a new pool for the novnc console on port 6080

MODIFY pools:
  - Update the horizon pool for port 443
  - Update the horizon pool to forward port 80 to 443

ADD virtual-servers:
  - Add a new virtual-server for galera on port 3307
  - Add a new virtual-server for novnc on port 6080
  - Add a new virtual-server for novnc with SSL on port 6080
  - Add a new virtual-server for the git repo on port 9418
  - Add a new virtual-server for the repo cache on port 3142

MODIFY virtual-servers:
  - Update the galera virtual-server for mirroring
  - Update the horizon virtual-server for an ssl cert


Executing a leapfrog upgrade
----------------------------

The first step is to checkout the RPC-O r14.1.0 tag. This will remove
any uncommitted information from the rpco repo, so back that up if it is
required.

.. code-block:: shell

    root@kilo:/opt/rpc-openstack# git reset --hard
    git clean -df
    pushd openstack-ansible
    git reset --hard
    git clean -df
    popd
    git fetch origin
    git checkout r14.1.0
    git submodule update
    git status


It is crucial that the rpco repo and openstack-ansible submodule are both clean
and at the appropriate SHAs for r14.1.0 at this stage. The `github
r14.1.0 tag
page <https://github.com/rcbops/rpc-openstack/tree/r14.1.0>`_ shows both SHAs,
the RPCO SHA is the latest commit, and the OSA SHA is shown as an annotation
after @ on the openstack-ansible submodule.

Two variables will need to be set in `/etc/openstack_deploy/user_variables.yml`
before proceeding with the upgrade

.. code-block:: yaml

    lxc_container_backing_store: "dir" # 'dir' is the tested value. Other options are "lvm" and "overlayfs"
    neutron_legacy_ha_tool_enabled: "yes"


These variables are required by later versions, but are not defined in Kilo or Liberty.

Elasticsearch container keeps all logs and will not be rebuilt in leapfrog.
User can override envrionment variables to force it reset and rebuilt before proceeding with the upgrade

.. code-block:: shell

    export UPGRADE_ELASTICSEARCH="no"
    export CONTAINERS_TO_DESTROY='all_containers:!galera_all:!neutron_agent:!ceph_all:!rsyslog_all'


The next step is to execute the leapfrog upgrade script

.. code-block:: shell

    root@kilo:/rpc-upgrades# ./scripts/ubuntu14-leapfrog.sh


Structure of the leapfrog process
---------------------------------

.. image:: doc/images/leapfrog_structure_diagram.png

The RPCO leapfrog scripts are a thin wrapper around OSA-OPS leapfrog tools.Â 

For details please refer to the scripts themselves. Paths are omitted for
brevity, scripts may not be in the root of the relevant repo.


Pre Leap
~~~~~~~~

This step removes modifications to RPCO Kilo that aren't compatible with RPCO
Newton. Currently this only contains an Ansible 1.9 compatibility workaround.


Prep
~~~~

This step executes pre-flight checks, and prompts the user for confirmation. It
also ensures that the databases are backed up. Backups are stored in
/openstack/backup on the physical host that houses the first galera container.


Upgrade
~~~~~~~

This step has a section for each major version between the source (Kilo) and
target (Newton) versions.

Each section includes:
  - Variable & Secrets Migration (OSA)
  - Fact Cleanup
  - Hostname Compatibility checks/modifications.
  - Inventory Upgrades


Migrations
~~~~~~~~~~

The step runs the database migrations for each major upgrade in turn.
For a RPC Kilo --> Newton upgrade this involves running the liberty,
mitaka and newton migrations in sequence.


Re-Deploy
~~~~~~~~~

This step first runs the pre_redeploy script which handles RPC variable and
secret migrations. Next the target version of OSA is deployed.
During this stage, one of the original neutron agents containers is left running
to minimise downtime.


Post Leap
~~~~~~~~~

This step deploys the RPC additions on top of the already deployed OSA.


Rollback and Interruption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Leapfrog upgrade is a one way process, once it has begun there is no
rollback. Once the services have been upgraded, they make changes to the
virtualisation and networking layers that would be difficult and disruptive
to reverse.

If a leapfrog upgrade is interrupted, it can be resumed. Each major step of the
leapfrog upgrade process creates a marker file, which will be used to skip
completed tasks on subsequent runs.

To resume, run ./ubuntu14-leapfrog.sh.

If a step fails information about that step will be printed along with all the
remaining steps. The operator must fix the failure before re-running the
leapfrog or completing the remaining steps manually.


Confirmation Prompts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The leapfrog process does not run unattended, it requires the operator to
confirm at two points.

Near the start:
  - Confirm intention
  - Check source version

Before deploying the target version:
  - This gives the user the opportunity to check the integrity of
    migrated rpco variables and secrets before continuing.


Problems
--------


Clone Failures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The leapfrog process includes many git clones from github, if these requests are
rate limited, tasks can fail due to timeouts. As github is beyond our control,
the only solution is to wait for rate limits to reset before retrying.


Galera
~~~~~~

Occasionally the galera cluster may be in a non-functional state after the
leapfrog. If this is the case, follow the `Galera Maintenance section of the OSA
operations guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/openstack-ansible/newton/developer-docs/ops-galera-recovery.html>`_.


Confirmation Prompts and the Ctrl-c warning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The confirmation prompts instruct the user not to interrupt the leapfrog process
via ctrl-c. While an uninterrupted upgrade is the smoothest, the consequences
of interruption are not as dire as implied. The process can be resumed by
re-running the top level script, which will skip the steps that have already
been completed by checking for the existence of marker files.

#### Restarting the leap after the OSA ops upgrade.sh gives a wrong prompt
One of the confirmation prompts requires the operator to confirm the version that
they are upgrading from, this is compared against a detected source version.
When resuming the leapfrog process after an Interruption the files used to check
the source version may already have been upgraded, in this case the operator
will have to specify the target version (Eg Newton) when prompted for the source
version.

#### Standalone Deploy Node
If the deploy node (host that the top level leapfrog script is run from) is not
one of the openstack infrastructure (api) nodes, then python-mysql may fail to
install. If this happens, then `libmysqlclient-dev` must be installed
before retrying:

.. code-block:: shell

    apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev


This issue is being tracked as `LA-342 <https://rpc-openstack.atlassian.net/browse/LA-342>`_.
