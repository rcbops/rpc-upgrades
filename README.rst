Rackspace Private Cloud - Upgrades

Overview
--------

Incremental
-----------

Incremental upgrades are major version to major version upgrades that leverage the upstream 
run-upgrade.sh script provided in each release of Openstack Ansible.  They are used for
releases for releases Newton and on.  They allow a stairstep approach to upgrading the
environment.

Supported incremental upgrades (must be running on Ubuntu 16.04):

* Newton to Pike (Ocata is skipped)
* Newton to Queens

Full docs for Incremental upgrades are `here <incremental.rst>`_.

Leapfrog upgrades from:

* kilo to r14.23.0 (newton)
* liberty to r14.23.0 (newton)
* mitaka to r14.23.0 (newton)
