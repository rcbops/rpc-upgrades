__doc__ = """Script usage.
The "is_ssh_address" and "is_container_address" keys are required in the
[ openstack_user_config.yml ] file. These keys tell OpenStack-Ansible which
networks will be used for network connectivity and managing ssh sessions to the
containers and hosts. This script will look for the required keys. If the keys
are not found they will be appended to the "br-mgmt" network.

When this script executes it will return 0 if there are no changes. If the
script does change the anything it will return 3. Any other return code should
be considered an exception.
