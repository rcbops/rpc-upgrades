    Elasticsearch log data would be lost in the process of leapgfrog upgrade
    due to rebuilding ELK containers. (Liberty to Newton)
upgrade:
  - |
    New environment variable 'UPGRADE_ELASTICSEARCH' is 'no' by default to
    avoid interrupting standard deployment. When leapfrog upgrade is started,
    'UPGRADE_ELASTICSEARCH' is set to 'yes' automatically, so the setup of
    Elasticsearch 'elasticsearch.yml' play will be skipped in
    'setup-logging.yml' play, which helps preserving Elasticsearch logs.
    Another new environment variable is 'CONTAINERS_TO_DESTROY', which
    indicates what kind of containers needs to be rebuilt and excludes
    'elasticsearch_all' by default.
